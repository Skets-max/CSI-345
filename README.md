## Implemented Endpoints (Task 6)

### 1. Student Registration Service
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/registrations` | Register a new student (validates with SARMS, hashes password, sends verification email) |
| `POST` | `/registrations/:id/confirm-email` | Confirm email using token from verification link |
| `POST` | `/registrations/resend-verification` | Resend the verification email (rate-limited to 3/hour) |

### 2. Membership Management Service
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/memberships` | Activate membership after confirmed payment |
| `PATCH` | `/members/:id/block` | Block a member account *(admin only)* |
| `PATCH` | `/members/:id/unblock` | Unblock a member account *(admin only)* |

### 3. Equipment Booking Service
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/bookings` | Create a booking (checks membership, availability, prevents overlaps) |
| `PATCH` | `/bookings/:id/cancel` | Cancel a booking (30-min window enforced) |

### 4. Payment Service
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/payments` | Initiate a Stripe payment session for membership fee |

## Key Integration Points

| External Service | Used For |
|-----------------|----------|
| **SARMS API** | Student validation during registration |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing + webhook confirmation |
| **Nodemailer (SMTP)** | All email notifications (verification, OTP, booking reminders, etc.) |
| **QRCode + PDFKit** | Membership card generation and PDF download |

---

## Security Features
- JWT authentication on all protected routes
- Role-based access control (student vs admin)
- Bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- Input validation on all POST endpoints via `express-validator`
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting on auth and registration endpoints
- Oracle transactions for data integrity

---

## Notes for Postman Testing
1. Call `POST /registrations` first, check your email for the verification link.
2. Confirm email via `POST /registrations/:id/confirm-email`.
3. Initiate payment via `POST /payments` – use Stripe's test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
4. The Stripe webhook fires automatically (use [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) for local testing: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/payments/webhooks/gateway`).
5. Once membership is active, test `POST /bookings` and `POST /cards`.
